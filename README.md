# The Chinese Reading Machine (CRM) (in-progress)

## Overview
This extension will allow users to interactively learn how to read Chinese with any text-based article on the web by providing word segmentation, pinyin support, and a database of a user's "vocabulary-dictionary" of user-saved phrases. Articles are uploaded to the site and parse using the Stanford CoreNLP library.

## To-Dos
A lot to do to get this up and running. Tasks are being tracked externally using Trello and design docs uploaded to the /design folder.

## Zhongwen Extension (future)
This feature will be built on top of the existing Zhongwen Google Chrome extension to facilitate easier article importing and give students the option of different immersive experiences
